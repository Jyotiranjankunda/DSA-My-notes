## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms form the backbone of computer science and play a crucial role in solving complex problems efficiently. Understanding the core concepts of DSA is essential for writing optimized code, designing efficient algorithms, and acing technical interviews.

This repository aims to provide handwritten concept notes that explain various DSA topics in a clear and concise manner. The notes are designed to be beginner-friendly, providing step-by-step explanations and visual representations to enhance understanding. Whether you are studying for academic purposes, preparing for coding interviews, or simply looking to deepen your DSA knowledge, these concept notes will serve as a valuable resource.

## Concept Notes

The concept notes in this repository cover a wide range of DSA topics, including:

- Array and String Manipulation
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Binary Search Trees
- Graphs and Graph Algorithms
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming
- and more!

Each concept note is presented in a handwritten format, making it visually appealing and easy to follow. The notes include explanations of important terminology, key concepts, algorithms, and sample code snippets. Feel free to explore the concept notes and dive deeper into the world of DSA.

## Questions

In addition to the concept notes, this repository also provides a collection of hand-written questions to practice your understanding of DSA concepts. These questions cover various difficulty levels and are designed to test your problem-solving skills. By working through these questions, you can enhance your ability to apply DSA concepts in real-world scenarios.

The questions are accompanied by detailed explanations and code solutions, helping you understand the thought process behind solving each problem. Whether you prefer implementing the solutions in your favorite programming language or analyzing the logic behind them, these questions will serve as valuable practice material.


Happy learning and happy coding!
